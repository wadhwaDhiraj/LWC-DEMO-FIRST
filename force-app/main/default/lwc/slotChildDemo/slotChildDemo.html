        <!-- If we have a element like the footer one below, in which 
        the parent is sending data twice (separately) we want to make sure
        that the element is rendered only when data is present, and we achieve
        this with the help of onslotchange attribute, where we can manage the
        visibility of the element using the "slds-hide" property. Amazing.
        And that's why we keep it hidden by default, so that we can display it
        when we get actual data-->
